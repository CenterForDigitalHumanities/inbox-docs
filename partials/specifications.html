                    <p>
                        The <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> is based on a presentation given at the
                        <a href='http://iiif.io/event/2017/vatican/'>Vatican 2017 IIIF Conference</a>
                        by <a href="http://jeffreycwitt.com/">Jeff Witt</a> and
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/chipgoines">Chip Goines</a>. Further cooperation
                        with <a href='https://github.com/regisrob'>Régis Robineau</a> of
                        <a href='http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr/'>Biblissima</a> added another
                        implementer the list. Together with <a href='https://github.com/cubap'>Patrick Cuba</a>
                        (Lead Developer, <a href='https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities'>Walter
                            J. Ong, <small>S.J.</small> Center for Digital Humanities</a>), the plan
                        was made to offer an exemplar for a general use inbox that did not
                        require the hosting institutions to maintain their own. <a href='http://rerum.io'>RERUM</a>
                        offered a home for this that extended the mission of creating and sharing
                        open and public knowledge around important research.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Primary Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a service of <a class='tooltipped' data-tooltip='Walter J. Ong, S.J. Center for Digital Humanities' href='https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities'>OngCDH</a>,
                        the <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> is committed to providing a free and
                        public location for important announcements about scholarly resources.
                        This offers a service to individuals and institutions without the
                        financial or technical means to host their own inbox and creates a
                        path for interaction with the vast holdings on the Internet that are
                        otherwise inaccessible. By generating new inboxes dynamically,
                        <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> immediately and universally opens the
                        resources used by the scholarly community to the contributions of the
                        scholars it comprises.

                        There are a few very near goals for <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> that
                        can be offered, but this path may change if the community has other needs.
