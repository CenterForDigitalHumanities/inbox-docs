                    <p>
                        The <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> is based on a presentation given at the
                    <a href='http://iiif.io/event/2017/vatican/'>Vatican 2017 IIIF Conference</a>
                    by <a href="http://jeffreycwitt.com/">Jeff Witt</a> and
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/chipgoines">Chip Goines</a>. Further cooperation
                    with <a href='https://github.com/regisrob'>RÃ©gis Robineau</a> of
                    <a href='http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr/'>Biblissima</a> added another
                    implementer the list. Together with <a href='https://github.com/cubap'>Patrick Cuba</a>
                    (Lead Developer, <a href='https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities'>Walter
                        J. Ong, <small>S.J.</small> Center for Digital Humanities</a>), the plan
                    was made to offer an exemplar for a general use inbox that did not
                    require the hosting institutions to maintain their own. <a href='http://rerum.io'>RERUM</a>
                    offered a home for this that extended the mission of creating and sharing
                    open and public knowledge around important research.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Primary Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a service of <a class='tooltipped' data-tooltip='Walter J. Ong, S.J. Center for Digital Humanities' href='https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities'>OngCDH</a>,
                        the <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> is committed to providing a free and
                        public location for important announcements about scholarly resources.
                        This offers a service to individuals and institutions without the
                        financial or technical means to host their own inbox and creates a
                        path for interaction with the vast holdings on the Internet that are
                        otherwise inaccessible. By generating new inboxes dynamically,
                        <strong>Rerum Inbox</strong> immediately and universally opens the
                        resources used by the scholarly community to the contributions of the
                        scholars it comprises.
